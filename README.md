# Note-Taker
This Note Taker project will allow the user to be able to easily create notes on the appropriate page, and store them on a side bar, where when clicked, the note will render onto the main note section. The user can also easily click the + button to be able to clear the note section and create a new note, and hit a save button to add it to the saved notes section. Users can also hit the delete button within the saved note section for the respective note to remove it, which removes it from the saved notes database. Users can add as many notes as they would like, and delete as they would like. The app was deployed using heroku.
